Can we make sure our plan keeps working?


Friend,

We're only halfway through 2016, and already we've seen the horrendous damage that Republicans can do.

First, they repeatedly refused to consider President Obama's nominee for the Supreme Court. Then they refused to stand up to Donald Trump, and he became their nominee. Next, they refused to pass funding to fight the water crisis in Flint Michigan and tried to use the public health crisis of the Zika virus to place restrictions on women's right to choose. And then -- then, after all of these transgressions and blatant refusals to help the American people -- they blocked commonsense gun safety reforms despite another tragedy shaking our nation. 

So I'm fighting with Democrats to win Senate races in strategic states -- and this month alone, we've raised well over $30,000 for some of the most important Democratic candidates in the country. I'm fighting with everything I've got for a Democratic majority. 

Now I need your help to make sure that we're building a strong grassroots movement in New York as we make progress across the country. That's why showing that our campaign has your strong support before the critical FEC end-of-quarter deadline tonight is absolutely necessary.

Will you donate $25 so we can reach our campaign goal of $10,000 before midnight TONIGHT? http://links.chuckschumer.mkt4644.com/ctt?kn=3&ms=OTEzMzI2MgS2&r=MTQyOTI3NTM3MjE5S0&b=2&j=OTQyODY1OTUyS0&mt=1&rt=0 

We have to work together to make sure this will happen. We have to work together to fight for justice -- economic justice, environmental justice, racial justice, and gender justice. And we have to work together to make sure that the NRA and the Republican senators in the gun lobby's pocket don't threaten the safety of Americans. 

This is the biggest fundraising deadline of the year so far. I need to prove that you're by my side as we tackle the problem that is a Republican-led Senate -- and change it for good.

If you're with us on this, donate $25 so we can reach our campaign goal of $10,000 and make sure our Senate works for all of us.

Sincerely,
