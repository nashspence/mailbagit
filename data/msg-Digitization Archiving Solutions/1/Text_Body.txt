Good Afternoon!

My name is Matthew McCabe and I’d like to introduce myself as the VP, Sales & Marketing for The Crowley Company <https://thecrowleycompany.com/>  (Crowley).  If you’re not familiar with Crowley, we provide a full range of digitization solutions ranging from front-end capture <https://thecrowleycompany.com/digitization-products/> , ECM integration <https://thecrowleycompany.com/laserfiche-ecm/> , as well as “best in class” cultural heritage scanners <https://thecrowleycompany.com/digitization-products/scanner-type/cultural-heritage-scanners/>  (offering up to FADGI <https://thecrowleycompany.com/digitization-services/fadgi-digitization-services/>  4-star quality).  

 

With more than two decades <https://www.linkedin.com/in/mccabematthew/>  in the records management industry, I’m excited about the opportunity to offer you brand name production-level scan systems with built-in software that adds maximum image quality, enhanced productivity, and increased efficiency that are all user friendly and packed with functionality. 

 

Crowley’s capture offerings include:

•                     document scanners <https://thecrowleycompany.com/digitization-products/scanner-type/document-scanners/> 

•                     microform scanners <https://thecrowleycompany.com/digitization-products/scanner-type/microfilm/>  (microfilm, microfiche, aperture card)

•                     book and large format scanners <https://thecrowleycompany.com/digitization-products/scanner-type/large-format-book-scanners/> 

•                     archive writers <https://thecrowleycompany.com/scanner-products/product-types/archive-writers/> 

We understand that you may be in the planning and preparation phase for FY ’22 and beyond and are thinking about your future digitization projects.  The next time you consider purchasing scanning equipment, we’d appreciate your consideration and encourage you to review Crowley’s Digitization Solutions.  That way should you need to ramp up production, replace an aging unit, or want to see the latest in digitization technology, you will be able to make an informed decision.

If you would like any additional information or would like to set up a time to speak more in detail about your collection and evolving requirements, then please don’t hesitate to ask.

 

Sincerely,
