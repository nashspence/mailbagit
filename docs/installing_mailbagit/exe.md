# Windows Executables

Executables are available for Windows that contain all dependencies except the [PDF dependencies]({{ site.baseurl }}/pdf). Download the latest `mailbagit.exe` and `mailbagit-gui.exe` files from the [Github releases](https://github.com/UAlbanyArchives/mailbag/releases).

You can run `mailbagit.exe` in the command line [just as you would use the `mailbagit` command]({{ site.baseurl }}/mailbagit):

```
mailbagit.exe path/to/export.pst -i pst -d eml warc -m my_mailbag -r
```

`mailbagit-gui.exe` will run just by double-clicking it.

These executables are unsigned, so Windows will likely give you as "Windows protected your PC" warning from Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. You will need sufficient permissions to allow unsigned executables on you machine.

### Unblocking `mailbagit.exe` and `mailbagit-gui.exe`

1. Right-click on `mailbagit.exe` or `mailbagit-gui.exe` and select "Properties".
2. On the bottom of the panel, click the checkbox near the bottom right corner labeled "Unblock". 
3. Select "Apply" and then "OK".

You should now be able to click on and run the executable. If the Unblock option is not visible, you probably don't have sufficent permissions to run the executables on your computer.
