## Project Outcomes

### [Mailbag Specification](https://archives.albany.edu/mailbag/spec/)

* A functional specification to package email exports using multiple formats in a [Bagit "bag"](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493).
* Ensures a structure where email messages will remain actionable among multiple formats.

### Command line Mailbag tool and Python library

* Will accept common email export formats and create valid "mailbags" according to the Mailbag Specification.
* Will optionally convert email exports to derivative formats and include them in a mailbag.
* Will include basic reporting functionality to list included messages.
* Will allow easy pathways to other email appraisal and processing tools.

### Basic graphical user interface (GUI) wrapper for command line Mailbag tool.

* Will include at least the basic functionality of the command line Mailbag tool.
* Will be accessible to users using assistive technology.
